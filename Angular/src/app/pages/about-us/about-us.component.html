      <h1><strong>SAFE AND FRESH VEGETABLES</strong></h1>
      <p><b style="color: green;">Sabji-Mart</b> aims to contribute by bringing fresh vegetables. As it is important to
        look for freshness in all vegetables we consume. Check the characteristic signs of freshness such as bright,
        lively color in the vegetable and look to see if the vegetable is crisp and free of soft spots. Vegetables are
        at their peak during their harvest season, this is also when vegetables are the most affordable to purchase. One
        of the most important reasons for purchasing fresh is the nutritional value that freshness.</p>
